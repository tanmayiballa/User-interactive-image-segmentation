# User-Interactive-Image-Classification

This project is an attempt to provide a user-friendly platform to people, where they can upload images, and extract the required objects with/without the background. The application runs above the famous deep-learning model: Mask R-CNN, essentially used for image classification and segmentation. We have utilized the capabilities of frameworks such as FastAPI and ReactJS to ensure smooth user interaction and a seamless user interface. We have leveraged this application by hosting it on the AWS cloud, thereby providing a solution that is reliable, flexible, and scalable according to the requirements. The efficient infrastructure provided by AWS helps our application to function optimally, thereby enhancing user satisfaction. The final results of this application are pretty decent with an extraction rate of 95% for the known classes of the model. Though Mask R-CNN takes time to retrieve results, we have optimized the application in terms of time by decreasing the number of service calls and creating the required user responses in the front end. Overall, our application performs well by providing the results in approx. 30 seconds, which is decent for a model having Mask R-CNN as the backend.
